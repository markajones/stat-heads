Jekyll is a static html website generator. You can use the provided tools to construct a site for you or you can build one up from scratch. In my view the latter approach is of more value since it forces you to comprehend what you are doing. 

Installation and basic hosting setup
------------------------------------

If you want the Jekyll quick start, just go <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/">here</a>. For the slow inclined, read on. I am os x based. Jekyll relies on Ruby, which is pre-installed on os x. To check whether you have it installed and your version, open the terminal and type:

```
$ ruby -v
ruby 2.0.0p481 (2014-05-08 revision 45883) [universal.x86_64-darwin13]
```
You can install jekyll using gem as follows (technically you shouldn't have to sudo).

```
sudo gem update —-system
sudo gem install jekyll
```

If you want to host your site on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, (GitHub pages actually) sign up. If you don't have <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, go get it and install. You may need to do a bit of googling to understand what GitHub and git are and how to use them. You'll also need to do some set up to establish an interaction between your local and the remote files. In a nutshell they give you control over the history of your computer files. Technically they are referred to as revision control. Anyway, create a respository for your site in GitHub such as: <u>http://myname.github.io/name-of-repository</u>.

```
git init my-awesome-site
cd my-awesome-site
echo "My readme" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m “my first commit”
git remote add origin http://myname.github.io/name-of-repository.git
git push -u origin master
```

Now create a branch called `gh-pages` and delete the master since you don't need it. This establishes the repository as one that will be served by GitHub pages.

```
git checkout -b gh-pages
push origin gh-pages
git push origin --delete master
```

Create a site
-------------

The Quickstart for Jekyll suggests `jekyll new my-awesome-blog`, `cd my-awesome-blog` then `jekyll serve`, I do not.

This is the basic website file structure layout that you are aiming at understanding. It is a lot simpler than it looks.

│   └── common.scss
└── index.html
```

First construct the `config.yml` file, like so:

```
# Site settings
# You MUST have a space after the : on each line!!!!
markdown: redcarpet
title: Your awesome title
email: your-email@domain.com
description: > # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this
  line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for
  Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.
baseurl: /statistical-thinking # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/
url: "http://yourdomain.com" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
sass: 
sass_dir: _sass
```

The sass stuff is not really necessary at this stage. If it creates problems, remove those lines from the file. Now create yourself and `index.html` in the root directory of your website project. The `index.html` is the default file that is loaded if you do not specify a file at the end of a URL. With Jekyll you need to specify a <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a> <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/">header</a> in your index file. You don't need to worry about the details of YAML.

```
---
layout: default
---

<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>One day we will be looping over posts...</p>
``` 

The reference to default refers to a layout that you specify in a _layout directory. A layout is a way of specifying common content that want to reuse. Start with a default that looks something like this. The `{% raw %}{{ content }}{% endraw %}` line is a Jekyll command that lets you pick up content from other files.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

    <title>A title</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{site.baseurl}}/css/common.css">
</head>

<body>
<div class="container">
    {% raw %}
    {{ content }}
    {% endraw %}
</div>
</body>
</html>
```   

The CSS will not be picked up but that doesn't matter at this stage. HTML is for content, CSS is for styling. Anyway, if you `cd my-awesome-website` directory and `jekyll serve --watch --baseurl ""`

Jekyll does its stuff and combines the files you have written into a `_site` folder. The contents of the `_site` folder is what you see when you go to the `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` URL in your browser. Not all the files are in place yet but there should be something working...

Bootstrap
---------

<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> is a pervasive HTML, CSS and JavaScript framework for developing sites. It can easily be integrated into Jekyll projects. Download the version ported from Less to <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>. In a nutshell, Sass lets you produce CSS is a slightly less labouriously manner than by hand. Jekyll supports the use of Sass. First create the css directory and the `common.css` within it. The common.css can be as simple as follows.

```
---
---

// override the bootstrap by introducing standard css here.

// and finally import the bootstrap styles on which the site depends
@import "bootstrap";
```

The `common.css` file will thus contain all the style elements you need. More on this <a href="http://markdotto.com/2014/09/25/sass-and-jekyll/">here</a>.

Site Navigation
---------------

Navigation is based on a bootstrap the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/examples/starter-template/">bootstrap starter template</a>, hence the introduction of Bootstrap above.

Simply copy the relevant bits of the template into the `nav.html` in the `_includes` directory. Then by adding a  `{% raw %}{% include nav.html %}{% endraw %}` line within `default.html`, as below, gives you a static navigation bar.

```

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

    <title>A title</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{site.baseurl}}/css/common.css">
</head>

{% raw %}{% include nav.html %}{% endraw %}

<body>
<div class="container">
    {% raw %}
    {{ content }}
    {% endraw %}
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

Posts
-----

Jekyll has a reliance on a particular name format for posts contained within the `_posts` directory. It is just something you need to know and can find more about it <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/">here</a>. An example of a post and its header is below, they are most easily written in markdown <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>.

```
---
layout: article
title: Jekyll 101
meta: First set of notes on Website development using Jekyll
category: web
---

<!-- add markdown formatted post here -->

```


In order to view the posts create the `article.html` file in the root directory (as per the directory tree). Jekyll provides the ability to loop over all the posts with particular category meta data provided in the YAML header of the post.

```
---
layout: default
---

<h1>Web</h1>
<ul>
    {% for post in site.categories.web %}
    <li>
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{{post.url}}">{{post.title}}</a>
        <p>{{post.meta}}</p>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

Custom Domains
--------------

These seem to be a nightmare of confusion. Basically the aim is the have the content of your GitHub repositories reached using your custom domain such as <a href="tstudent.org">tstudent.org</a>.

I took a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/">user page</a> repository and added a CNAME with the content `tstudent.org` with added the following details in the `_config.yml`. Note that the basic setup for a user page is trivial and well documented at <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.

```
baseurl: "" 
url: "http://tstudent.org"
```

I took a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/">project page</a> repository and added a CNAME with the content `tstudent.org` with added the following details in the `_config.yml`.

```
baseurl: "" 
url: "http://tstudent.org"
```

Within the Domain provider's configuration settings I modified the CNAME reference to point to my github repository of interest, i.e. t-student.github.io.
